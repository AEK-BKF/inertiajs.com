# Routing

With Inertia all routing is defined server-side. Meaning you don't need Vue Router or React Router. Simply create routes in your server-side framework like you always have.

## Responses

To make an Inertia response, use `Inertia::render()`. This function takes two arguments, the component name, and the component data (props).

~~~php
use Inertia\Inertia;

class EventsController extends Controller
{
    public function show(Event $event)
    {
        return Inertia::render('Event', [
            'event' => $event->only('id', 'title', 'start_date', 'description'),
        ]);
    }
}
~~~

## Redirects

When making a non-GET Inertia request, via `<inertia-link>` or manually, be sure to still respond with a proper Inertia response. For example, if you're creating a new user, have your "store" endpoint return a redirect back to a standard GET endpoint, such as your user index page. Inertia will automatically follow this redirect and update the page accordingly. Here's a simplified example.

~~~php
class UsersController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return Inertia::render('Users/Index', ['users' => User::all()]);
    }

    public function store()
    {
        User::create(
            Request::validate([
                'first_name' => ['required', 'max:50'],
                'last_name' => ['required', 'max:50'],
                'email' => ['required', 'max:50', 'email'],
            ])
        );

        return Redirect::route('users');
    }
}
~~~

Note, when redirecting after a `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` request you must use a `303` response code, otherwise the subsequent request will not be treated as a `GET` request. A `303` redirect is the same as a `302` except that the follow-up request is explicitly changed to a `GET` request.
