# CSRF protection

If your web framework includes cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, you'll need to ensure that each Inertia requests includes the necessary token for `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.

## Include token as prop

One solution is to include the CSRF token as a prop on every response. You can then use the token when making Inertia requests.

```js
this.$inertia.post('/users', {
  name: this.name,
  email: this.email,
  _token: this.$page.csrf_token,
})
```

You can even use the <a href="/shared-data">shared data</a> functionality to automatically include the `csrf_token` with each response.

## Include token as cookie

However, a better approach is to use the CSRF functionality already built into [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for this. Axios is the HTTP library that Inertia uses under the hood.

Axios automatically checks for the existence of an `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. If it's present, it will then include the token in an `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header for any requests it makes.

The easiest way to implement this is using server-side middleware. Simply include the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie on each response, and then verify the token using the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header sent in the requests from axios.

Some frameworks, such as [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.8/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php#L176-L188), do this automatically, meaning there is no configuration required.
